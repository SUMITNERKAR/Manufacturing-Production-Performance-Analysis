# Manufacturing-Production-Performance-Analysis

I recently had the opportunity to develop a Manufacturing Review Dashboard as part of my role, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Manufactured Quantity: Over 49.79 million units
Processed Quantity: 60.02 million units
Rejected Quantity: 491,023 units
Wastage Quantity: Directly linked to rejections
Problem Statement:
The dashboard aims to address inefficiencies in manufacturing capacity by identifying discrepancies between manufactured and processed quantities, as well as analyzing rejection rates across employees and departments. This insight is crucial for optimizing processes and improving overall operational efficiency.

Key Observations:
The dashboard highlighted discrepancies between manufactured and processed quantities, indicating areas for potential improvement.
Employee-wise and machine-wise rejection analysis unveiled insights into performance variances and equipment efficiencies, prompting actionable recommendations.
Recommendations:
Targeted improvements in specific departments
Regular maintenance for machines with higher rejection rates
Training sessions for employees to minimize rejections
